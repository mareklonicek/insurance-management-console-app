### The C# console application for managing insured persons

It offers full CRUD functionality for managing a database of insured persons

Built using object-oriented programming and utilizes a C# List object for saving data

This is my version of a basic exam project (in console only) for the C# exam and obtaining the C# certificate in the Czech ITnetwork education portal.
